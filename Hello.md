System of a Down’s ‘Toxicity’: 5 Things You Didn’t Know
-------------------------------------------------------

1.  **The album was released a week before 9/11 and topped the Billboard 200 the week of the tragedy.**
2.  **Producer Rick Rubin offered the band crucial feedback on their reliably demented lyrics – even though he had no idea what they meant.**
3.  **In contrast to the band’s first album, guitarist Daron Malakian went wild with overdubs on Toxicity.**
4.  **Despite its blatant orgy references, the blitzing “Bounce” was used in the family-friendly animated film _The Secret Life of Pets._**
5.  **Metallica were huge fans of the album.**
